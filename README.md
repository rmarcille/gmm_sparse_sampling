This project uses data from the open-source dataset MeteoNet *MeteoNet, An Open Reference Dataset by Meteo France – Larvor et al. – 2020* *https://meteonet.umr-cnrm.fr/*

Methods from *Yildirim et al. 2019 – Efficient sensor palcement for ocean measurements using low-dimensional concepts, Ocean Modelling* and *Manohar et al. 2018 – Data-driven sparsre sensor placement for reconstruction: demonstrating the benefits of exploiting known patterns, IEEE Control Systems Magazine* are implemented.
